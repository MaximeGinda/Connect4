# Connect4

## Project description

This Connect4 game is a group project made in the context of a "Algorithm of Exploration and Movement" class.

The main goal was to develop a simple adversarial game with an AI using the alpha-beta pruning method to explore the graph of possible moves and return the best for the AI's team. A secondary objective was to use Agile methods (with weekly scrums, a Scrum Master and a Product Owner).

## How to install and run

### Installation

You can clone/download the Unity project. You will need a recent-enough version of Unity though.

### Running

Using Unity "build and run", you can build (expect some waiting) and run your own version of the project.
You can also directly use the executable in the /Build folder.

## How to play

The main menu allows to start the game against the AI or against a second player. You can also quit the game.

During a game, you can move the cursor with the left and right arrows of the keyboard and place a token by pressing the spacebar. In a Player Versus Player game, you must take turn on the keyboard.

You can also return to the main menu by pressing the Escape key.

Against the AI, you will have to wait until the AI is finished playing (~1 second).

When the game is over, you can restart it by pressing the spacebar again.

## Credits

Every member developed at least some of the code of the project. We often work in groups of two (inspired by the Pair Programming Methodology).
